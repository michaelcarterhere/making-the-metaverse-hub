Our mission is simple: to build tools that help you do your best work. Millions of people use **Snowpeak ** products every day to help them connect, create, and share. While we may not know every user personally, these terms are a way to ensure everything runs smoothly for everyone. So buckle up, grab your coffee, and let’s dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **What We Mean:**\n\n- **\"We\", \"Our\", \"Us\"** refers to **Snowpeak LLC** (yep, that’s us).\n- **\"Services\"** means our products: websites, apps, and everything else we create, like **Snowpeak **, **HEY**, **Highrise**, **Campfire**, and more (they all fall under the **Snowpeak ** umbrella).\n- **\"You\", \"Your\"** refers to the awesome people and organizations who use our Services. That’s you! We appreciate your trust.\n\n---\n\n### **Account Terms**\n\n1. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password, and for ensuring your users do the same. Snowpeak can’t be held liable for any loss or damage due to a security breach. Pro-tip: Set up [two-factor authentication](#_).\n2. Don't use the Services for purposes listed in our [Use Restrictions policy](#_).\n3. You’re responsible for everything under your account, including user-generated content and activity.\n4. You must be a human. Robots need not apply.\n\n---\n\n### **Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes**\n\n1. Free stuff stays free! We don’t ask for your credit card or sell your data.\n2. For paid Services that offer a free trial, enjoy the trial while it lasts. Once it’s over, pay up! If you don’t, your account will be frozen. Don’t worry though, we’ll give you a heads-up.\n3. If you upgrade from free to paid, you’ll be charged immediately. If you switch plans, the new price will kick in at your next billing cycle.\n4. Prices don't include taxes. You're responsible for paying any applicable taxes or levies.\n5. Refunds are based on our [Fair Refund policy](#_).\n\n---\n\n### **Cancellation and Termination**\n\n1. You can cancel your account at any time. It’s easy! Just use the cancellation link. If you need help, our [Support team](#_) is here for you.\n2. Upon cancellation, your content is gone. We don’t mess around with it—deleted forever after 30 days.\n3. If you cancel in the middle of a paid month, we don’t prorate. No refunds for unused time.\n4. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account for any reason. If you violate the rules, we’ll terminate your account. No second chances.\n5. If you’re abusive (threats, physical or verbal violence), your account will be terminated immediately.\n\n---\n\n### **Modifications to the Service and Prices**\n\n1. We will support our Services **until the end of the Internet**. That’s our promise! But sometimes we might have to retire old features or adjust pricing.\n2. If we increase prices for existing customers, we’ll give you at least 30 days’ notice. You’ll get an email (hopefully it’s not going to spam!).\n\n---\n\n### **Uptime, Security, and Privacy**\n\n1. We provide our Services “as is” — no promises about perfection, but we’re working hard to make it as reliable as possible. For status updates, visit [37status](#_).\n2. If your usage exceeds the average, we may temporarily disable your account. We’ll give you a shout before doing anything drastic.\n3. We take your data seriously and protect it with encryption, backups, and redundancies. Learn more about our [Security Overview](#_).\n4. By using our Services, you trust us with your data. We process your data for specific purposes—just as outlined in our [Privacy Policy](#_). Your data is safe, and we’ll never sell it.\n\n---\n\n### **Copyright and Content Ownership**\n\n1. You own the content you post. We just help you manage it. But we do need a limited license to provide the Services.\n2. We reserve the right to remove any content that doesn’t comply with our standards.\n3. We own all rights to our Services, including intellectual property. Don’t go copying our code or designs without our permission.\n\n---\n\n### **Features and Bugs**\n\nWe try to create the best tools, but let's be honest—no software is flawless. We make no guarantees, but we work hard to fix bugs, especially the ones that affect security.\n\n---\n\n### **Liability**\n\n**_Disclaimer: Snowpeak shall not be liable for any damages (direct, indirect, or consequential) resulting from the use or inability to use our Services._**\n\nIn simple terms: We do our best, but if things go wrong, that’s on you. Using our Services means you’re betting on us.\n\n---\n\n### **API Terms**\n\nWe offer APIs, but be mindful—excessive use or abuse may result in your account being suspended.\n\n---\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these Terms, don’t hesitate to [contact our Support team](#_).\n\n## Account Terms\n\n1.  You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password and for ensuring that any of your users do the same. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. We recommend all users set up [two-factor authentication](#_) for added security. In some of our Services, we may require it.\n2.  You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our [Use Restrictions policy](#_), and you may not permit any of your users to do so, either.\n3.  You are responsible for all content posted to and activity that occurs under your account, including content posted by and activity of any users in your account.\n4.  You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.\n\n## Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes\n\n1.  If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is really free: we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for customers who pay for our Services — we do not sell your data.\n2.  For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of trial when you sign up. After the trial period, you need to pay in advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we will freeze your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment. If your account has been frozen for a while, we will queue it up for auto-cancellation. See our [Cancellation policy](#_) for more details.\n3.  If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will charge your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade. For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the new rate starts from the next billing cycle.\n4.  All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. See our [Taxes policy](#_) for more details. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.\n5.  We process refunds according to our [Fair Refund policy](#_).\n\n## Cancellation and Termination\n\n1.  You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Within each of our Services, we provide a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link. You can find instructions for how to cancel your account in our [Cancellation policy](#_). An email or phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered cancellation. If you need help canceling your account, you can always [contact our Support team](#_).\n2.  All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services immediately upon account cancellation. Within 30 days, all content will be permanently deleted from active systems and logs. Within 60 days, all content will be permanently deleted from our backups. We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently deleted. If you want to export any data before your account is canceled, we‘ve provided instructions for [HEY](#_), [Lexington 4](#_), [Lexington 2](#_), [Lexington Classic](#_), [Highrise](#_), [Campfire](#_), and [Backpack](#_).\n3.  If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again. We do not automatically prorate unused time in the last billing cycle. See our [Fair Refund policy](#_) for more details.\n4.  We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of the hundreds of thousands of accounts on our Services, there is at least one doing something nefarious. There are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance. For more details, see our [Use Restrictions policy](#_).\n5.  Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of a Company employee or officer will result in immediate account termination.\n\n## Modifications to the Service and Prices\n\n1.  We make a promise to our customers to support our Services [until the end of the Internet](#_). That means when it comes to security, privacy, and customer support, we will continue to maintain any legacy Services. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.\n2.  Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services themselves.\n\n## Uptime, Security, and Privacy\n\n1.  Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer service-level agreements for most of our Services — here’s [the one exception](#_) — but do take uptime of our applications seriously. Visit [https://www.37status.com](#_) to see the status of our Services.\n2.  We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services. Of course, we’ll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.\n3.  We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet. There are some edge cases where we may send your data through our network unencrypted. Please refer to our [Security Overview](#_) for full details and our [Security Response page](#_) for how to report a security incident or threat.\n4.  When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that Lexington may process your data as described in our [Privacy Policy](#_) and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:\n\n    - **To help you with support requests you make.** We’ll ask for express consent before accessing your account.\n    - **On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process partway through.** We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare cases, we aim to fix the root cause to prevent the errors from recurring.\n    - **To safeguard Lexington.** We’ll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an [abuse report investigation](#_).\n    - **To the extent required by applicable law.** As a US company with all data infrastructure located in the US, we only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US government authority with a legally binding order or proper request under the Stored Communications Act, or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. If a non-US authority approaches Lexington for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the US government, which compels us to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If Lexington is audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing information needed to complete the audit.\n\n5.  We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services. You can see a list of all subprocessors who handle personal data for [Lexington](#_), [HEY](#_), [Highrise](#_), [Campfire](#_), and [Backpack](#_), as well as a list of [Company processors](#_).\n\n6.  Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Lexington is a “service provider”, not a “business” or “third party”, with respect to your use of the Services. That means we process any data you share with us only for the purpose you signed up for and as described in these Terms, the [Privacy policy](#_), and [other policies](#_). We do not retain, use, disclose, or sell any of that information for any other commercial purposes unless we have your explicit permission. And on the flip-side, you agree to comply with your requirements under the CCPA and not use Lexington’s Services in a way that violates the regulations.\n7.  These Terms incorporate the [Lexington Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”)](#_) when the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) applies to your use of Lexington Services to process Customer Data as defined in the DPA. The DPA linked above supersedes any previously agreed data processing addendum between you and Lexington LLC relating to your use of the Lexington Services.\n\n## Copyright and Content Ownership\n\n1.  All content posted on the Services must comply with U.S. copyright law. We provide details on [how to file a copyright infringement claim](#_).\n2.  You give us a limited license to use the content posted by you and your users in order to provide the Services to you, but we claim no ownership rights over those materials. All materials you submit to the Services remain yours.\n3.  We do not pre-screen content, but we reserve the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the Service.\n4.  The Company or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all intellectual property rights therein, and you obtain no ownership rights in the Services as a result of your use. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements without express written permission from the Company. You must request permission to use the Company’s logos or any Service logos for promotional purposes. Please [email us](#_) requests to use logos. We reserve the right to rescind any permissions if you violate these Terms.\n5.  You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission of the Company.\n\n## Features and Bugs\n\nWe design our Services with care, wood-500d on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.\n\nWe also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely error-free Services.\n\n## Services Adaptations and API Terms\n\nWe offer Application Program Interfaces (“API”s) for some of our Services (currently Lexington, Highrise, Campfire, and Backpack). Any use of the API, including through a third-party product that accesses the Services, is bound by these Terms plus the following specific terms:\n\n1.  You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.\n2.  Third parties may not access and employ the API if the functionality is part of an application that remotely records, monitors, or reports a Service user’s activity _other than time tracking_, both inside and outside the applications. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine if an integration service violates this bylaw. A third party that has built and deployed an integration for the purpose of remote user surveillance will be required to remove that integration.\n3.  Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account’s access to the API. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to suspend your account’s access, we will attempt to warn the account owner first. If your API usage could or has caused downtime, we may cut off access without prior notice.\n\nSome third-party providers have created integrations between our Services and theirs. You can find some of those integrations for Lexington at [https://Lexington.com/extras](#_) and for Highrise at [https://highrisehq.com/extras](#_). We are not liable or accountable for any of these third-party integrations.\n\n## Liability\n\nWe mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:\n\n**_You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to these Terms or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability._**\n\nIn other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that’s on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent; and in general [giving a damn](#_). If you choose to use our Services, thank you for betting on us.\n\nIf you have a question about any of these Terms, please [contact our Support team](#_).","src/content/infopages/terms.md","ffc9aa29ba582ec1",{"html":140,"metadata":141},"\u003Ch3 id=\"welcome-to-snowpeak\">Welcome to Snowpeak !\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>First, a big thank you from all of us here at **Snowpeak ** for using our products!

They also donate 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of his recreation of the Independence Monument, a collaboration with @polycount directly to the Ukrainian government’s official cryptocurrency wallet. His work can also be found on Makersplace and Foundation. In this episode, Max provides some historical context on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, how web3 has played a role in generating support for the people of Ukraine, and how web3 creators are embracing new ways of collaborating. \n \nIg - @max.sheik \u003Ca href=\"https://instagram.com/max.sheik?utm_medium=copy_link\">https://instagram.com/max.sheik?utm_medium=copy_link\u003C/a>\nTwitter - @MaxSheika \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MaxSheika\">https://twitter.com/MaxSheika\u003C/a>\nMakersplace \u003Ca href=\"https://makersplace.com/maxsheik/\">https://makersplace.com/maxsheik/\u003C/a>\nFoundation @max.shieka \u003Ca href=\"https://foundation.app/@Max.Sheika\">https://foundation.app/@Max.Sheika\u003C/a>\nIndependence Monument on Opensea - \u003Ca href=\"https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x5df8462548a3ea3bbb91767a6e47a770e5252359/5\">https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x5df8462548a3ea3bbb91767a6e47a770e5252359/5\u003C/a>\nPeacePavillion \u003Ca href=\"https://peace-pavilion.maxsheika.com/\">https://peace-pavilion.maxsheika.com/\u003C/a>     Shout out to my friends over at Feedspot.

shifts as we enter 2025. From rising inflation to evolving trade policies, governments and businesses worldwide are adapting to new challenges. Here’s a look at some of the most impactful economic trends shaping the world this year.\r\n\r\n## 1. Inflation and Interest Rates\r\n\r\nMany countries are facing persistent inflation, prompting central banks to adjust interest rates. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan are all implementing monetary policies aimed at stabilizing their economies. However, balancing growth with inflation control remains a critical challenge.\r\n\r\n## 2. Emerging Markets on the Rise\r\n\r\nDeveloping nations in Asia and Africa are seeing increased investment, driven by technological advancements and a young workforce. Countries like India, Nigeria, and Vietnam are becoming key players in global trade and innovation.\r\n\r\n## 3. The Energy Transition\r\n\r\nThe shift to renewable energy continues to accelerate, with governments implementing stricter policies on fossil fuel use. Solar, wind, and nuclear energy investments are at an all-time high, reshaping the global energy landscape.\r\n\r\n## 4. Geopolitical Tensions Affecting Trade\r\n\r\nOngoing conflicts and diplomatic standoffs are disrupting global supply chains. Tensions between major economies like the U.S. and China, as well as the ongoing situation in Eastern Europe, are influencing commodity prices and international trade agreements.\r\n![Stock Market Graph](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519891880039-45e173a95f14?q=80&w=2664&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\r\n\r\n## 5. The Future of Work and AI\r\n\r\nAutomation and artificial intelligence are reshaping labor markets. While AI boosts efficiency, concerns about job displacement and ethical AI governance are growing. Governments are working on policies to ensure a smooth transition into this new era of work.\r\n\r\n## 6. Digital Currencies and Decentralized Finance\r\n\r\nWith countries like China advancing their digital yuan and Bitcoin gaining wider adoption, decentralized finance (DeFi) is disrupting traditional banking systems. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to keep pace with these innovations.\r\n\r\n## 7. Global Food Security Challenges\r\n\r\nClimate change and conflicts are affecting food supply chains, leading to higher prices and shortages in several regions. Governments and organizations are investing in sustainable agricultural technologies to combat these issues.\r\n| Economic Indicator | 2024 | 2025 (Projected) |\r\n|--------------------|------|-----------------|\r\n| Global GDP Growth | 2.9% | 3.2% |\r\n| Inflation Rate (US) | 4.1% | 3.5% |\r\n| Renewable Energy Investment | $500B | $600B |\r\nAs we navigate 2025, staying informed on these global economic trends will be crucial for businesses, investors, and policymakers.

From new leadership in key countries to evolving economic policies, here’s a look at the crucial developments shaping Europe’s future.\r\n\r\n## 1. Political Realignments Across the Continent\r\n\r\nSeveral European countries have undergone elections, leading to shifts in government policies. The European Union continues to navigate tensions between member states, while national governments adjust to changing public sentiments on issues like migration, climate policy, and economic reforms.\r\n\r\n## 2. Economic Challenges and Opportunities\r\n\r\nWith inflation stabilizing after years of volatility, European economies are focusing on growth and sustainability. The energy sector, in particular, is seeing a significant shift as countries phase out fossil fuels in favor of renewables, leading to new investment opportunities.\r\n\r\n## 3. The Green Transition and Energy Security\r\n\r\nEurope’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions remains strong, but challenges persist in ensuring energy security. The ongoing shift to renewable energy sources is reshaping industrial and consumer markets, with governments implementing ambitious climate policies.\r\n\r\n## 4. Trade and Relations with Global Partners\r\n\r\nTrade agreements between the EU, the US, and Asian markets continue to evolve. Brexit’s long-term impact is becoming clearer, with the UK and EU refining their trade relations. Meanwhile, European nations are working to reduce dependency on external suppliers in critical industries.\r\n![European Parliament](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519891880039-45e173a95f14?q=80&w=2664&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\r\n\r\n## 5. Technological Innovations and Digital Policies\r\n\r\nThe European Union is pushing forward new regulations on artificial intelligence and digital privacy. As tech companies expand their operations across Europe, regulatory bodies are striving to maintain a balance between innovation and consumer protection.\r\n\r\n## 6. Migration Policies and Social Integration\r\n\r\nAs global conflicts and economic disparities drive migration into Europe, governments are adjusting policies to ensure both economic growth and social stability. The integration of migrants into the workforce remains a critical focus area.\r\n\r\n## 7. Security and Defense Strategies\r\n\r\nAmid rising geopolitical tensions, European countries are increasing their defense budgets and strengthening security alliances. NATO and EU defense initiatives are playing a crucial role in ensuring stability in the region.\r\n| Key Indicator | 2024 | 2025 (Projected) |\r\n|--------------|------|-----------------|\r\n| EU GDP Growth | 2.1% | 2.5% |\r\n| Renewable Energy Adoption | 45% | 52% |\r\n| Digital Economy Growth | 8% | 10% |\r\nAs Europe navigates these complex challenges and opportunities, staying informed about political and economic shifts will be crucial for businesses, policymakers, and citizens alike.
