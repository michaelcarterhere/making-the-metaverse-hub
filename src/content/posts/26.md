In a pioneering move, the City of Kingston Police Force have utilized drone technology to identify and ticket drivers using handheld devices at major intersections. During a recent enforcement blitz, 20 distracted driving tickets were issued, each supported by drone-captured video evidence. One perspective to take here is that the approach enhances road safety and exemplifies the integration of advanced technology in municipal law enforcement. Despite some claims that this has never been done before, Kingston’s initiative aligns with a broader global trend: Thunder Bay, Canada: Police have tested drones to spot drivers texting or dialing on their cell phones, leading to successful enforcement actions. Poland: Law enforcement agencies have employed drones equipped with high-resolution cameras to detect and fine drivers using phones while driving. While these technologies offer promising solutions to enhance traffic safety, they also raise important discussions about privacy and surveillance. In Kingston, the Canadian Constitution Foundation has expressed concerns regarding potential violations of privacy rights under Section 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. As cities worldwide adopt smart technologies to improve public safety, it’s crucial to balance innovation with respect for individual privacy. Transparent policies and community engagement will be key in navigating these advancements responsibly.
