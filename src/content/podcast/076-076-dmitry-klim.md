## Show Notes

<p>Dmitry Klim is a dynamic and multi-talented individual. In less exciting times he worked in developing online commerce. One day, he decided he didn’t want to be an NPC and started manifesting a new life for himself. This has led him through a career in real estate, he hung around the music industry, and ultimately walked into web3 through a series of chance meetings. He is currently the chief business development officer for Qappi where he is building communities around high quality web3 projects. </p>
