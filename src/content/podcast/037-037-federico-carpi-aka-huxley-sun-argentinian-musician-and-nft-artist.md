## Show Notes

<p>Hi! I'm Michael Carter and my guest today on Making the Metaverse is Federico Carpi, an Argentinian musician and NFT artist living in Poland. Under the name Huxley Sun, Federico writes, records and performs as a musician offering an indie-folk sound that is delivered at a slow pace with a contemplative style. Federico also creates NFT artwork in a unique visual aesthetic. His NFT project offers collectors special benefits linked to his music releases. Today we talk about how web3 is changing the music industry and what it means for artists and listeners. We also talk about the role being played by NFTs in these changes.</p>
