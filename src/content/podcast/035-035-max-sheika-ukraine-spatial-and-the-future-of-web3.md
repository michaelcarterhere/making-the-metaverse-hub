## Show Notes

Max Sheika is a Ukrainian 3D artist and architect. His recent work has been dedicated to generating support for the people of Ukraine. This includes a special collaboration with Spatial.io through sales of his Metaverse design known as the Peace Pavillion. They also donate 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of his recreation of the Independence Monument, a collaboration with @polycount directly to the Ukrainian government’s official cryptocurrency wallet. His work can also be found on Makersplace and Foundation. In this episode, Max provides some historical context on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, how web3 has played a role in generating support for the people of Ukraine, and how web3 creators are embracing new ways of collaborating.
