## Show Notes

<p>Sourav Deb is co-owner of Guerrilla Music and a thought leader in the Web3 space.</p>
<p>Sourav and his partner have successfully built a socially conscious company that exists on the blockchain but is focused on growth in the real world. &nbsp;Through Guerrilla Music they have initiatives like the Color the Blockchain campaign. They hold free online courses to onboard people who want to learn but haven’t had the resources to do so. They teach in the cadence of hip hop so it’s easy to break through the language barrier of blockchain lingo. For the past year they’ve been raising money to support and assist artists in developing countries. As Guerrilla Music is owned by a woman and a person of color, inclusivity is important to them.</p>
<p>They’ve recently launched the $RAP Token and are in the prelaunch stages of an NFT drop and Play to Earn game featuring their RAP HEADZ characters. $RAP Token is used in voting for their MetaVerzus events held in Decentraland and has many in real life uses.</p>
<p>They have created wearables for National Geographic, Jim Jones, Zap Theory, Forever 21, Space 1 Mission, Ice Poker, The Hundreds, Penguin Fight Club, Tru Community and more.</p>
<p>Sourave is also a genesis artist as the first Canadian rapper to mint an audio NFT, a resident DJ in the ICE Poker lounge and the host of the MetaVerzus events in Decentraland.</p>
