## Show Notes

<p>My guest today is Piers Ridyard, CEO of RDX Works, core developers of Radix, the first layer one protocol for DeFi that started from the problem of how to decentralize the $400 trillion global economy and worked backwards.</p>
<p>Piers has been in the blockchain space from the very beginning. Today, he shares a historical perspective on DeFi, talks about his vision for the future and illustrates the role standards play in the development of networks. I also learn a new term from Piers: ‘ujamaflip’.</p>
