## Show Notes

<p>My guest today is Sati, a digital artist and NFT creator with a fierce dedication to her craft. She has a life long love of graffiti, canvases and all the traditional art she can get close to. Several years ago she discovered digital art and it heavily influenced her illustration style and way of thinking.&nbsp;Now she is developing her own brand and working on a range of NFT projects. <br>
 <br>
In her art, she explores themes of identity, love, and melancholy. Her art style also incorporates influences from retro futuristic aesthetic, music, anime and life experiences. Her largest project, TV Obsession, was featured on the front page of OpenSea at the peak of the NFT boom. Her journey has not always been a walk in the park but she has remained dedicated to her art and persevered through difficult times. Sati has a wealth of experience to share with artists and collectors in this very special one year anniversary episode of Making the Metaverse.</p>
