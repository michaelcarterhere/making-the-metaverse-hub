## Show Notes

<p>My guests today on Making the Metaverse are Wilfred Lee and Sardwell who are working together on a phygital project called Renisis. Renisis is a multidimensional world that takes you to another place, physically and emotionally, providing superpowers to be stronger and present your best self. It combines fine jewelry crafted by Sardwell with sounds and AI generated artwork created by Wilfred. Working together they have created a truly unique project that bridges the physical and digital realms.&nbsp;</p>
