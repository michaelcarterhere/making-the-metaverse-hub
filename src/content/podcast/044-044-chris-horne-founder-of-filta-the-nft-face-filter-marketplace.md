## Show Notes

<p>Chris Horne is an Emmy and Peabody award winner with deep experience developing projects that marry frontier technology with the arts - from filmmaking in VR at Oculus, running the core UX/UI team on Facebook's next-generation Social VR platform (basically the Metaverse), and specializing in fixing some of the largest and gnarliest shots at Pixar. His current project, Filta, is an NFT face filter marketplace that lets you create, trade and wear face filter and avatar NFTs. FIlta is backed by Y Combinator.</p>
