## Show Notes

<p>Iana is a digital fashion designer. She moved to Europe three years ago after graduating in theoretical and applied linguistics in Moscow. After five years in the field of intercultural communication she decided to find her actual passion and purpose. During that period of her life, she and her Dutch fiancee decided to see the world and to travel across Europe. They've traveled to Sweden and lived in Greece, France and Italy. Iana traveled with very few clothes but with her sewing machine and laptop in hand. She didn’t always have the opportunity to sew, so she started studying digital fashion. After three years of self-studying she became a professional digital fashion designer.&nbsp;</p>
