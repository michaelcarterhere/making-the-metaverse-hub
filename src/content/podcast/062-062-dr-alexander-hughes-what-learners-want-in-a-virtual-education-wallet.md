## Show Notes

<p>Really enjoyed speaking with Dr. Alexander Hughes about his recent eCampusOntario report titled “Wallets, Passports, Portfolios, Credentials: What Learners Want in a Virtual Education Wallet.” Alex shared insights on what learners think about access, use and adoption of a virtual wallet system that stores digital educational credentials. According to Jill Dunlop, Minister of Colleges and Universities, “The research carried out by eCampusOntario clearly indicates that learners are interested in and receptive to virtual wallets for storing their educational credentials.” </p>
