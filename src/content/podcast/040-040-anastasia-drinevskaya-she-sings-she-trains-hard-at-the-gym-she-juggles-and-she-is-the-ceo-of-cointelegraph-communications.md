## Show Notes

<p>Anastasia Drinevskaya is the most dynamic and interesting human in web3. She has multiple degrees, a love of theatre and fashion, she kicks b*tt in the gym, she models, she can juggle, and there is a rumour that she will soon breathe fire. Oh and she is CEO of Cointelegraph communications. On top of all of this, she is incredibly warm and genuine, cares deeply about the blockchain community, and wants to give 'power to the people' through blockchain technologies. If web3 was a marvel cinematic universe, she would be one of the superheroes. So sit back, relax and enjoy this very special episode of Making the Metaverse!&nbsp;</p>
