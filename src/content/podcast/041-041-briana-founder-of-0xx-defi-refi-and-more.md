## Show Notes

<p>Entrepreneur and crypto educator Briana founded 0xx to be a welcoming front door for other women to walk through. Frustrated by the lack of financial safety nets for new mothers in the freelancing world, Briana knew there must be other options and began exploring decentralized, accessible wealth building options in Web3.</p>
<p>Discouraged by the overabundance of bro-marketing and utter lack of accessible education, Briana set out to raise the bar with making crypto truly accessible to women from all walks of life. Her goal is to act as a catalyst for bringing together the bold—those that want to radically uplift the world and their bank accounts.</p>
